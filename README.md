## Neemesh Yadav

I am an 18 year old Undergraduate student and a Python Developer, currently pursuing Computer Science and Biosciences from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/).
I am currently learning DSA in Python for Competitive Programming, and Flask for developing Web Apps and some future projects.
I have a major interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and am looking forward to collaborate and enter this field in the future.
