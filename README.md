Hi!

I'm Neemesh and I do AI/NLP research. I like working on problems that can help us understand AI behavior, its reasoning (and improving it), and its bias (Computational Social Science basically)! I also like learning about how these AI systems work (yes, interpretability is cool!).

This page is not updated as often as [my personal homepage](https://stealth-py.github.io/) is so you're better off going there if you wanna know more about where I am, what I am doing / like doing!
